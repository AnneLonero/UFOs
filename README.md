# UFOs

## Overview:
We are building a webpage catalogs the UFOs sightings including date, city, state, country and spotted shape using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sighting, we are adding more filters which allow users to seach for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results:
The image below shows webpage we built with multiple filters search and the list of all sightings with details.

Users can look up data using a single filter. For example, we enter "1/4/2010" in the "Enter Date" area and all the sighting for the date 1/4/2010 shows:

Users can also search the page using more than one filter at the same time. For example, we enter "1/4/2010" for the "date" and "CA" for the "state" and the result shows:

With the way the page built, users can use up to 5 filters to look for exact sighting that they desire.

## Summary:
The webpage performs the function that we are looking for which is looking for sighting data. However, it is missing a clear search function which help users clear out the outcome and start a new search. Right now, the only way to clear out the output is to refreshing the page.

We recommend adding the clear filter function to resolve this draw back and adding more picture and links to these sighting, for example, an article in the news, etc.
